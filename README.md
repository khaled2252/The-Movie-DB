# This MVC is Implemented on Main Screen as follows

1) Model contains Data , NetworkCalls
2) View Contains Listeners which call methods from controller
3) Controller Contains all business logic , doesn't contain any android packges, only pure language

# MVC disadvantages

1) Tightly coupled
2) Not testable
3) Not Reusable
4) Conflicts (i.e How to treat activity ? as view or controller? )
